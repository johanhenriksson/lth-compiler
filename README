SimpliC LLVM Compiler
Johan Henriksson (dat11jhe@student.lu.se)

Requirements:
    * Built & Tested on OSX 10.10 Mavericks
    * Requires LLVM 3.8.x

Note: Will not run on school computers out-of-the-box since they havee
      an older version of LLVM. 

Setup/Usage:
    1. Compile C library
        - Go to src/clib
        - Run make.sh or simply compile lib.c to lib.o

    2. Run tests
        -  Go to /
        -  Run "ant test"

    3. Compile JAR
        - Go to /
        - Run "ant jar"

    4. Compile and execute files
        A tool to quickly compile and execute files is included in the JAR
        and can be used as follows:

        java -jar compiler.jar hello_world.simplic

        Warning: this tool is pretty shitty. It's usually better to use the
        test system to compile and/or execute programs.
